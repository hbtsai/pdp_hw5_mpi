google parallel connected components for more references. 

parallelizing introduced: 

1. randomly select half of the nodes as root. 
2. re-label nodes that connected to roots as the label of the root it connected to. 
3. remove the edges of roots and their leaves. (remove edges between nodes that shares common label)
4. relink existing edge to root nodes.
5. repeat after all edges are removed. 
6. the number of nodes whose label matches its index is the number of connected components.
